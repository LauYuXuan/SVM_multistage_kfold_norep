# SVM_multistage_kfold_norep
This Bash script is designed to perform a machine learning analysis on a given independent dataset file (in CSV or Excel format) and generate various performance metrics, feature rankings, and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the script's functionality:

Input Validation: The script first checks if the required argument (the independent data file) is provided. If not, it displays the usage instructions and exits.
Output File Preparation: The script generates dynamic output file names for the log file (output_file) and the Python script file (python_script) based on the current date and time.
Python Script Generation: The script then writes the Python code to the python_script file. This Python code performs the following tasks:
Reads the independent data file (CSV or Excel) and prints some basic information about the data.
Extracts the unique labels from the column names.
Performs ROC analysis for each label:
Creates binary labels based on the current label.
Applies SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to resample the data.
Performs feature ranking using SelectKBest and prints the top 10 features.
Creates an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier.
Splits the data into training, testing, and validation sets.
Trains the classifier on the training data, evaluates it on the test data, and calculates the confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy, and ROC AUC (Area Under the Curve) for both the test and validation sets.
Plots the ROC curves for the test and validation sets and saves the plot as an image file.
Python Script Execution: The script then runs the Python script with the provided independent data file as an argument, and captures the output in the output_file.
Cleanup: Finally, the script removes the temporary Python script file.
To use this script, you need to have the following prerequisites:

The independent data file in CSV or Excel format, which should be provided as an argument to the script.
Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, imbalanced-learn, and numpy.
To run the script, save the provided Bash script to a file (e.g., ml_analysis.sh) and execute it with the independent data file as an argument:

bash ml_analysis.sh /path/to/independent_data_file.csv
This will generate the output_file and the ROC curve plot file(s) in the same directory as the script.

The output file will contain the detailed analysis results, including the feature rankings, classifier performance metrics, and the ROC curve information for each label.

This script is designed to be a starting point for bioinformatics-related machine learning analysis, and can be further customized and extended as needed.
